    "Here is some context:\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to create a very nice portfolio website meant to display my ability to code, and more so, my ability learn things and adapt very quickly. My degree is in aerospace materials and I have experience in research, drone teams, and many other mechanical/material/chemical/process engineering related projects/experiences, and I am applying to a series of jobs soon. I want to create a website using the 3d rendering engine three.js, and make an interactive website which allows the visitor on the website to control a rocket and go to different planets. Each planet will represent a different feature about myself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Something along the lines of:\n",
    "planet 1: about me\n",
    "planet 2: project showcase\n",
    "planet 2 moon 1: project showcase 1\n",
    "planet 2 moon 2: project showcase 2\n",
    "planet 3: links to github and linkedin and resume\n",
    "\n",
    "I have only used wordpress and figma to design a website through drag and drop, so I have no experience coding or creating such a complex website but I am more than up for the challenge. At the moment, I understand that I may need to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "(from my understanding)\n",
    "HTML: a markup language that is then \"skeleton\" of my website so to speak, it is the language that forms the backbone or structural layer of the website.\n",
    "CSS: a programming language that is the \"skin\" of my website so to speak, it is the language that forms the presentation of my website and specifies rules that can be assigned to the structural layer to make it look nice.\n",
    "Javascript: a programming language that is responsible for all the functionality of the website (links working, any dynamic website movement, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "I am an engineer so if you are able to provide a decently detailed plan of exactly what I need to learn, in what order, and how I should go about doing so, I can hopefully work with you in order to develop such a complex website. I am mainly looking for guidance and for you to point me in the correct direction and provide help coding the website. I will need help to understand the structure of creating a website and uploading it to a server where anybody on the internet can access my portfolio website."

    "Let's break down how these technologies work together and consider whether you need a framework like React, Angular, or Vue for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n",
    "HTML as the Foundation: HTML forms the structure of your website. It defines the content and layout elements like headers, paragraphs, links, and divs.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS for Styling: CSS is used to style the HTML elements. It controls the visual presentation, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript for Interactivity: JavaScript adds interactivity to your web pages. It can manipulate HTML and CSS to change the content, style, and behavior of your website in response to user actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linking Together:\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML can include JavaScript and CSS via <script> and <link> tags.\n",
    "JavaScript can dynamically modify HTML and CSS, reacting to user inputs or other events.\n",
    "Three.js and Frameworks\n",
    "Three.js: It's a JavaScript library that abstracts WebGL complexity and provides an easy-to-use API for 3D graphics. It works within the JavaScript ecosystem and can be included in your HTML like any other JavaScript file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do You Need a Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "For your project, which is primarily focused on 3D graphics and interactivity, a full-scale framework like React, Angular, or Vue may not be necessary.\n",
    "These frameworks are beneficial for large-scale applications with complex state management, routing, and data handling requirements.\n",
    "Considerations for Using a Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "If your website scales up or includes more complex features beyond Three.js (like user authentication, data management, etc.), a framework might be helpful.\n",
    "Frameworks can offer a structured way to organize your code, which can be beneficial for maintenance and scalability.\n",
    "Best Framework for Complex Projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "React: Known for its component-based architecture, making it a good choice for projects with reusable UI elements. React's ecosystem and community support are substantial.\n",
    "Vue: Simpler learning curve and is more flexible. It's a good choice if you want a balance between structure and simplicity.\n",
    "Angular: Offers a complete solution with a wide range of built-in features. It's more opinionated and has a steeper learning curve.\n",
    "Suggested Path:\n",
    "Start Without a Framework: Initially, focus on getting comfortable with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the basics of Three.js. Create a simple version of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate Your Needs: As your project progresses, assess whether the complexity of your site justifies introducing a framework. If you find yourself needing more organization or facing challenges that a framework could solve, then consider learning one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Learning: The web development field evolves rapidly. Stay open to learning and adapting as new needs and technologies emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, the choice of whether to use a framework can also depend on personal preference and the specific requirements of your project. Starting simple and gradually scaling up as needed can be a prudent approach."
